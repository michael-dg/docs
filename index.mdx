## What is Wealth Sprout AI?

Wealth Sprout AI is a comprehensive personal finance application designed to help you take control of your money and grow your wealth. More than just a budgeting tool, it's built around the philosophy that **financial independence is achievable for everyone** — and the journey should feel empowering, not overwhelming.

The app combines practical money management with a positive, supportive approach. Whether you're tracking daily expenses, planning for retirement, or managing rental properties, Wealth Sprout AI gives you clarity on where you stand today and a clear path toward where you want to be tomorrow. It celebrates your progress, helps you learn from setbacks, and keeps you motivated with actionable insights rather than guilt-inducing alerts.

Think of it as your financial co-pilot: organized enough to handle the complexity of modern finances, yet simple enough that checking in feels like a habit, not a chore.

## Core Philosophy

Wealth Sprout AI is structured around **three distinct time horizons**, each with its own dedicated space in the app. This separation helps you focus on what matters most at any given moment without getting lost in the details.

| Category | Focus | Time Horizon |
|----------|-------|--------------|
| **Daily** | Day-to-day money management | Present |
| **Planning** | Goals, projections, and debt strategy | Near to mid-term future |
| **Wealth** | Long-term asset building and investments | Long-term growth |

This structure reflects how we naturally think about money: the bills we pay this week are different from the retirement we're saving for, which is different from the rental property generating passive income. By keeping these concerns separate, you can make better decisions in each area.
